It consists of a West Building (WB), an East Building (EB), and a Data Center (DC), all connected through a frame relay switch. The Data Center is connected to the ISP to get to the simulated Internet (it's just a 4.2.2.0/24 network). All the IP subnets are indicated in a little legend key. Of course, you may wish to use whatever IP scheme you want.
